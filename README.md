#Assignment

* Fork this repository
* Create a feature branch
* Implement a basic search app in accordance with the supplied PDF
* The search can be performed against ANY publically available REST-api using javascript
* Search against title, display the title (or equivalent)
* Show partial matches in a list under the search box
* Arrow keys up/down should navigate partial searches
* Pressing [ENTER] should add the selected result with timestamp under the search box
* When changing the size of the window, the content should adapt to the viewport width responsively
* There is no requirement for persisting the saved results in any way. Reloading the page resets everything

What is important:

* Quality of Javascript / CSS
* Packaging
* General structure
* Is there a readme and does it contain enough information to run and verify the solution?

Solve the assignment with as much effort as you see fit.

When you are done, you can push your branch to your repo and notify us by emailing us the link to the branch on github
